                My VGS was a cool bulding with lots of weird corridors with art and quotes on the walls. 
                We had many cool and slightly hidden rooms around the building you could discover. The coffee was also amazing.

          Min skole Bryne vgs var en av norges største vidergående skoler. Skolen ble pusset opp nylig og har rundt 1600 aktive elever. Vi elsket kantinen.

            My highschool is Elvebakken vgs.
            Our former canteen lady is kind of famous. Her name is Wenche and she is featured in the youtube video "Wenches Cafeteria - Taco baguette". I reccomend watching it!
            Our school also had a secret room that you had to find by yourself, as no one would tell you were it is. I never found it...
